## Steps to run 
1. Install Python on the EV3 robot 
2. Install Ev3 extension on VsCode
3. Create a new project and (copy, fork, or download) the code to main.py file 
4. Edit the points in the main.py that corresponds to a figure 
5. Connect the EV3 robot and run the program using run and debug section
